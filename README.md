🏨 Hotel Management System (C++)This is a console-based Hotel Management System developed in C++. It allows users to manage room bookings, customer details, and restaurant orders for a small hotel. The system utilizes an std::unordered_map (Hash Map) for efficient in-memory data storage, providing fast $\text{O}(1)$ average time complexity for key operations like searching and insertion. Data persistence is handled by reading and writing records to a binary file.✨ FeaturesRoom Booking: Book rooms by entering customer details (Name, Address, Phone, Days of Stay).Room Types & Cost Calculation:Deluxe (Rooms 1-50): ₹10,000 per day.Executive (Rooms 51-80): ₹12,500 per day.Presidential (Rooms 81-100): ₹15,000 per day.Customer Information: Display details for a specific room or view a table of all currently allotted rooms.Customer Modification: Edit customer details (Name, Address, Phone, Days of Stay).Restaurant Ordering: Add meal costs (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner) to a customer's bill.Check-out: Delete a customer record, display the final bill (Room Cost + Food Bill), and make the room vacant.Data Persistence: Automatically loads records on startup and saves them to a binary file (Record.DAT) upon exit.🛠️ Technology UsedLanguage: C++Data Structure: std::unordered_map (Hash Map) for efficient record management.Libraries: <iostream>, <fstream>, <string>, <unordered_map>, <iomanip>, <limits>.Environment: Console/Terminal-based application.🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesYou need a C++ compiler (like g++ or Clang) installed on your system.Compilation and ExecutionSave the Code: Save the entire source code into a file named hotel_management.cpp.Compile: Open your terminal or command prompt and compile the file:Bashg++ hotel_management.cpp -o hotel
Run: Execute the compiled program:Bash./hotel
(On Windows, you might run hotel.exe)⚠️ Important Implementation Note (Serialization)The current implementation uses direct binary write/read operations (fstream::write and fstream::read) on the RoomData struct, which contains std::string members.This method is generally unsafe for robust C++ serialization:std::string objects manage dynamic memory pointers. Writing the struct's raw binary only saves the internal pointers and sizes, not the actual string characters.Reading this data back later will likely lead to invalid pointers, data corruption, or program crashes.For a production-ready application, the load_data() and save_data() functions must be refactored to use explicit serialization, where string lengths and character data are written and read individually.📄 Code StructureThe project is structured using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):RoomData Struct: Holds data for a single room/customer record.HotelManager Class:Manages the std::unordered_map<int, RoomData> rooms_map.Handles all I/O and menu logic.Contains methods for add_room(), display_room(), delete_customer_record(), etc.main() Function: Creates an instance of HotelManager and calls the main_menu() to start the system.
