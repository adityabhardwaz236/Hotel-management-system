🏨 Hotel Management System (C++)This is a console-based Hotel Management System developed in C++. It allows users to manage room bookings, customer details, and restaurant orders for a small hotel. The system utilizes an std::unordered_map (Hash Map) for efficient in-memory data storage, providing fast $\text{O}(1)$ average time complexity for key operations like searching and insertion. Data persistence is handled by reading and writing records to a binary file.
